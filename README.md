Learning to use GIT-version controlling system.

My name is Jere Sumell and I'm ICT-professional. Graduated in February 2017 from the degree program of Bachleor of Business and Administration in Information Technology at TUAS. I'm escpecially insterested in software engineering but other aspects of ICT-work and projects is also something I'm familiar with. 

I finally created this free GitHub-account for public repositories and projects to study and figure out how this Git-version controlling system really works.
